##### Abstract

*MarchenCode* contains Python code to compute the Green's functions from single-sided surface reflectivity data. There's also a code to perform Marchenko-based imaging using decomposed Green’s functions (upgoing). I embarked on this project in an effort to understand the Marchenko method. For learners proficient in MATLAB, you can download the original version of the code in MATLAB [here](https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Software:Marchenko_for_imaging) by Angus Lomas and Andrew Curtis
