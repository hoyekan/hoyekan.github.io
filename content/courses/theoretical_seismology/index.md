## Abstract

GEOP 591 is a graduate special course (called theoretical seismology) offered at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM). I took the course in Term 242  (Spring, 2025. January 12, 2025 - May 28, 2025). The course instructor during this period was Dr. Wei Zhou. <br>

Although some of the solutions in this repository can be found in classic theoretical seismology textbooks, such as Quantitative Seismology by Aki and Richards, I have a few issues with these texts. One major concern is that they often do not include detailed mathematical derivations for problemsâ€”something I greatly value. As such, these textbooks can be particularly challenging for beginners in theoretical seismology, as they tend to omit intermediate steps in the derivations. I had the same concern when I first started the course, as the lack of detailed explanations made it difficult to follow the material. <br>

The tutorials in this repository aim to bridge that gap. As such, a junior or senior undergraduate geophysics student with a solid understanding of integral and differential calculus should be able to follow the material in this repository without any problem. This material can also used by graduate students or faculties to teach theoretical seismology.
